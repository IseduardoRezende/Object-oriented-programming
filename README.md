# POO
Anotations of a student about POO

Hello everyone, I spent a few weeks studying the poo programming paradigm, whether in concepts, in practice and using all its forms and variations.
I liked it a lot and soon I will put more into practice! I love C#

Console.WriteLine("Hello World !");
Console.ReadLine();
